## About

<p> The project is a task management website. You can create you account, create task to others, make comments and check if other users are online.</p>
<p> Click here to go to [the dojo](https://dojo-app-6c985.web.app/). </p>

## Project

<p> This project was made with React using create-react-app and it uses Firebase for auth and database. </p>

### Challenges

<p> On the process of making the dojo, the most challenging feature for me was to implement the Firebase version 9 and React Router Dom version 6. I did all that by looking at the documentation and updating the project from Firebase version 8 and React Router Dom version 5. </p>
<p> For me, the results are incredible and I did not follow the tutorial provided by the professor which made me have a better understanding of how Firebase and React Router Dom work and also how to search and make use of the documentation. </p>
