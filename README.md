## Project

This project was made with React using create-react-app and it uses Firebase for auth and database.

### Challenges

On the process of making the dojo, the most challenging feature for me was to implement the Firebase version 9 and React Router Dom version 6. I did all that by looking at the documentation and updating the project from Firebase version 8 and React Router Dom version 5.
For me, the results are incredible and I did not follow the tutorial provided by the professor which made me have a better understanding of how Firebase and React Router Dom work and also how to search and make use of the documentation.
